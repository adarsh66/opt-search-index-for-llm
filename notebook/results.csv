The ADRs trade under the symbol TLSYY. The\nOTCMarkets is a decentralized market for securities that are not listed on a\nstock exchange. Trading on OTCMarkets occurs via a network of dealers who\ncarry inventories of securities to facilitate the buy and sell orders of\ninvestors. How many Telstra shares represent an Telstra ADR? Under the Telstra\nADR program, each ADR represents five Telstra shares. How is the dividend\ncalculated? The US dollar rate paid to holders of ADRs is calculated by\napplying the exchange rate used to convert the foreign dividend payment (net\nof local withholding tax) to US dollars, and adjusting the result according to\nthe ordinary share (ADR ratio). Can ADR holders vote at the Telstra AGM?\nVoting rights are not extended to ADR holders. Who is the ADR depositary and\nhow do I contact them? Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is the current\ndepositary bank for Telstra Group Limited’s ADR program. The depositary bank\nplays a key role in issuance as well as cancellation of ADRs.

vector,What is Telstra's sustainability strategy?,"Telstra's sustainability strategy is comprised of several targets across three key pillars: 

1. Responsible business - Telstra aims to be a sustainable, globally trusted company that people want to work for and with[doc4].
2. Digital futures - The company seeks to foster strong, inclusive communities that are empowered to thrive in a digital world[doc4].
3. Environmental solutions - Telstra intends to use technology to address environmental challenges and help suppliers, customers, and communities do the same[doc4].

Additionally, Telstra has made specific commitments to environmental sustainability, including achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, being carbon neutral in 2020, enabling renewable energy generation equivalent to 100% of its consumption by 2025, and reducing its absolute emissions by at least 50% by 2030[doc1]. The company is also Australia’s largest corporate purchaser of electricity from renewable projects connected to the grid, which contributes to decarbonizing the grid[doc1]. Effective waste management is also an important component of Telstra's overall sustainability strategy[doc1]. 

These initiatives are managed and driven by Telstra's Sustainability, External Affairs and Legal (SEAL) team, the Telstra Climate Executives Group, and the Telstra Audit and Risk Committee, which also makes recommendations to the Board on targets[doc1][doc4].","{""citations"": [{""content"": ""Our Sustainability, External Affairs and Legal (SEAL) team work\nacross the business to drive progress against the Strategy and manage\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities.

All this\ntranslates into plenty of action too. In December 2019, we announced our\ncommitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in line with\nthe Paris Agreement. We set further ambitious climate goals only a few months\nlater in March 2020: Be carbon neutral in 2020 Enable renewable energy\ngeneration equivalent to 100% of our consumption by 2025 Reduce our absolute\nemissions by at least 50% by 2030 This is important as, in an interconnected\nenergy grid, new renewable generation has the beneficial effect of\ndecarbonising the grid for everyone. Already, we are Australia’s largest\ncorporate purchaser of electricity from renewable projects connected to the\ngrid under project-specific agreements. While the output from these projects\ngoes into the total grid pool, rather than directly into our facilities, these\nagreements play a role in providing the investment certainty to enable these\nprojects to proceed. As the grid itself increases its proportion of renewable\nenergy due to agreements with us and others, the power that flows into our\nfacilities from the grid also becomes greener. The projects we have agreements\nwith, including such landmark sites as the Murra Warra Wind Farm and the\nEmerald Solar Park, generate renewable energy equivalent to the energy\nconsumption of 255,000 households.

We support projects that equip First Nations, regional and\ndisadvantaged communities to leverage technology to remedy and adapt to the\neffects of climate change where they live. We’re also helping build a movement\nof climate focussed citizen scientists and funding innovative climate tech\nprojects. We're unable to accept new proposals at this time We're currently\nfocused on optimising our existing partnerships and programs. Our Programs and\nPartners We partner with Australian charities and social enterprises on a\nportfolio of innovative tech projects that align to our goals, including: Code\nClub Australia We run Code Club Australia to support free volunteer-led code\nclubs in schools and libraries, and give teachers access to fun learning\nresources to teach coding basics and build skills. As part of our advocacy and\nawareness work, we also run the annual, global Moonhack campaign to get more\nkids coding.

Telstra\nHealth is now one of Australia's leading providers of eHealth solutions, and\nin May was selected by the government to deliver the National Cancer Screening\nRegister under a five year contract. This year, we also announced the sale of\nmost of our stake in Chinese online car sales site, Autohome, for what was a\n$1.8 billion profit on sale. Autohome has been a incredibly successful\ninvestment for Telstra. And we remain very proud of the role that we played in\nrapid growth since we first invested back in 2008. We believe the time was\nright for us to realize significant value for shareholders. We do, however,\nretain a 6.5% interest and a board seat. Let me now make some comments on\nTelstra's ongoing work in the community. We are continually seeking to\nidentify ways that can use our technology, skills and scale to operate more\nresponsibly, better serve vulnerable customers and help safeguard the\nenvironment to create long term value for our company and the communities in\nwhich we operate. For example, this year, we helped more than 1 million\nvulnerable customers stay connected. We reached more than 59,000 people\nthrough our digital literacy programs, which includes tech savvy seniors,\nTelstra Digital ambassadors, and our cyber safety awareness programs. And we\nalso provided $175 million of value through our social and community\ninvestment programs, which includes sponsorship and disaster relief, employee\nvolunteering and giving, and our customer and community digital inclusion\nprograms. Under the federal government mobile blackspots program, we are\ndeploying 429 new 3G, 4G base stations over three years to improve mobile\ncoverage for over 400 communities across Australia.

The\ndisadvantages of the scheme - overall we do not think there are any material\ndisadvantages from what has been proposed. But as explained in the scheme\nbooklet, there are a few costs and risks associated with the proposal. Those\ncosts are the one-off costs to the Telstra Group that are expected to arise if\nthe scheme is implemented. Those costs, excluding stamp duty, are not\nconsidered to be material to the Telstra Group. The overall one-off costs\nassociated with the scheme, most of which have already been incurred or will\nbe incurred regardless of whether the scheme is implemented, are expected to\nbe $126 million excluding stamp dutyand comprise incremental IT systems and\nprocess costs, advisor fees, the cost of the independent expert, and costs\nassociated with the scheme meeting and ongoing additional costs for the\nTelstra Group that might not otherwise arise. They will mainly be incremental\ncosts in connection with the administration of the new corporate structure\nand, in aggregate, are not material to the Telstra Group. The risks associated\nwith implementation of the restructure are summarized in the frequently asked\nquestions, A15 in the scheme booklet, and outlined in more detail in Section\n2.9 of the scheme booklet. Next steps - so should shareholder approval be\nobtained today, there are a number of next steps and key dates. Firstly, the\nscheme needs to be approved by the court to become effective. This approval\nwill be sought at the second court hearing which we expect to be held on 19th\nOctober 2022.

simple,How do I buy or sell Telstra shares?,"To buy or sell Telstra shares, you must use a broker, as Telstra cannot sell shares directly to investors. Here are some options for buying or selling Telstra shares:

- **Engage a Broker**: To buy Telstra shares, you can find a broker through the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) information on how to find a broker or adviser[doc4].
- **Sell Your Shares**: If you wish to sell your Telstra shares and do not have a broker, and if you are an issuer sponsored shareholder (identified by a Security Reference Number, or SRN), you can use the share sale facility provided by Link Market Services, Telstra’s share registry. You can contact Link Market Services to arrange for share sale forms to be mailed to your registered address. If your shares are sponsored by a participant (identified by a Holder Identification Number, or HIN), you will need to contact your sponsoring participant or broker[doc4].
- **Buying Shares in the US**: If you are in the US, you can contact a local stockbroker who should be able to assist you in buying international shares, including Telstra's. Alternatively, you could contact an Australian stockbroker[doc4].

simple,What is Telstra's sustainability strategy?,"Telstra's sustainability strategy includes several ambitious goals and commitments to operate as a responsible and sustainable business. The strategy comprises targets across three key pillars:

1. **Responsible business**: Telstra aims to be a sustainable, globally trusted company that is an attractive place to work and collaborate with[doc4].
2. **Digital futures**: The company is committed to fostering strong, inclusive communities that are empowered to thrive in a digital world[doc4].
3. **Environmental solutions**: Telstra seeks to use technology to address environmental challenges and assist suppliers, customers, and communities to do the same[doc4].

The strategy is driven by Telstra's Sustainability, External Affairs, and Legal (SEAL) team, which works across the business to progress the strategy and manage related risks and opportunities. Telstra has a Climate Executives Group overseeing the climate change work program and an Audit and Risk Committee that supervises climate risk management and makes recommendations to the Board on targets[doc1][doc4].

Some specific commitments within this strategy include:

- Achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, in line with the Paris Agreement[doc1].
- Becoming carbon neutral in 2020[doc1].
- Enabling renewable energy generation equivalent to 100% of Telstra's consumption by 2025[doc1].
- Reducing absolute emissions by at least 50% by 2030[doc1].

Additionally, Telstra's commitment to sustainability has been recognized by the Digital Production Partnership (DPP) Committed to Sustainability Programme, which celebrates and promotes good environmental practices in the media industry[doc4].","{""citations"": [{""content"": ""Our Sustainability, External Affairs and Legal (SEAL) team work\nacross the business to drive progress against the Strategy and manage\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities. As well as that, we have a\nTelstra Climate Executives Group that oversees the climate change work\nprogram, and a Telstra Audit and Risk Committee that oversees climate risk\nmanagement and makes recommendations to the Board on targets. All this\ntranslates into plenty of action too. In December 2019, we announced our\ncommitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in line with\nthe Paris Agreement. We set further ambitious climate goals only a few months\nlater in March 2020: Be carbon neutral in 2020 Enable renewable energy\ngeneration equivalent to 100% of our consumption by 2025 Reduce our absolute\nemissions by at least 50% by 2030 This is important as, in an interconnected\nenergy grid, new renewable generation has the beneficial effect of\ndecarbonising the grid for everyone. Already, we are Australia’s largest\ncorporate purchaser of electricity from renewable projects connected to the\ngrid under project-specific agreements. While the output from these projects\ngoes into the total grid pool, rather than directly into our facilities, these\nagreements play a role in providing the investment certainty to enable these\nprojects to proceed. As the grid itself increases its proportion of renewable\nenergy due to agreements with us and others, the power that flows into our\nfacilities from the grid also becomes greener. The projects we have agreements\nwith, including such landmark sites as the Murra Warra Wind Farm and the\nEmerald Solar Park, generate renewable energy equivalent to the energy\nconsumption of 255,000 households. We will continue to build on this work and\ninvest in renewable energy generation. Effective waste management is an\nimportant component of the overall sustainability strategy too.

When will the change take place? Devices will be\nprogressively updated, starting from 23rd May 2022. All devices are scheduled\nto be upgraded by 30 June 202. How do I make the change? It’s simple. Firstly,\nyou will receive a software maintenance update message via your device. You\napply that as per a normal software update, waiting for your device to\nrestart. Once the device has restarted you will click on to your Samsung\nMessages application and it will give you the option to turn on Google Chat\nfeatures. If you consent to that and Google’s terms, the RCS service is\nenabled. What happens if I don’t want to consent to the software update? If\nyou don’t consent, you can still use the Samsung Messages application on the\ndevice as you do today. However, your messaging experience will default back\nto SMS/MMS instead of RCS. What happens to my existing/old messages? Do I\nstill have access to those? Any existing messages that you have in your\nmessaging application will be maintained and will be available post the\nsoftware upgrade. What will happen to my existing group chats on RCS?

Perhaps if directors fees had an expiry date, it'd\nhonour me to understand what this meant. CHAIRMAN CATHERINE LIVINGSTONE: Thank\nyou, Mr Hunter. I mean, in terms of the fees that we charge for certain\nmethods of payment of bills, this is really to help offset the costs in\nproviding the ability to pay the bills in that way given that we have enabled\nso many other platforms in terms of digital ways of paying the bills, and we\nwould really encourage as many people as possible to take advantage of those\nmethods to pay their bills.

HANS WITTEVEEN: Madam Chairman, I would have to express my\ndisagreements with you and my support for the previous speaker on the subject\nof having to pay a fee to pay your bill. The way business is done in this\ncountry is that you use a service. You expect to pay for it. You get an\ninvoice or an account, whatever you want to call it, you pay it. You don't\nhave to pay a surcharge for you to accept payment. If you want to express it\nas a discount for a different payment platform, I guess that's an option to\nlook at. In my personal customer experience, so before the meeting started, I\nhad an issue with bill payment. My account has just been altered without my\nrequest or consent to pay to have a bill rendered by email. I find that\nobjectionable because this was computer generated. It wasn't something I've\nwanted. I've had it fixed. The people at the front fixed it fairly quickly and\nefficiently.

In terms of the benefit to shareholders, the\nparticipation in the buyback was an individual decision for shareholders,\ndepending on their circumstances, and as you point out, there are different\ncircumstances for different shareholders. But we believe that the buyback was\nin the best interests of all shareholders, and buybacks actually benefit\ncontinuing shareholders in the sense that there are fewer shares on issue and\ntherefore the earnings per share does go up and over the long term that\nunderpins the share price. So, a buyback has important benefits for continuing\nshareholders, just as it might provide benefits for those shareholders whose\ncircumstances lead them to participate in the buyback. But we did, as a board,\nwe deliberated and took into account the interests of all shareholders in\nmaking that decision as part of our portfolio of capital management, which did\ninclude, as you know, increasing our ordinary dividend both at the interim and\nthe final dividend this year.

And to do so at 14% reduction to the weekly average\ntrade is a bit like this scam bloke who sends us off letters to say I'll buy\nyou shares for nothing. So, at 14% discount that then sold at around about 50%\nto the purchase price. And while I'm on that point, the share, Telstra share\nprice is still performing abysmally.

semantic,What is Telstra's sustainability strategy?,"Telstra's sustainability strategy comprises of several targets across three key pillars: 
1. Responsible business - aiming to operate as a sustainable, globally trusted company that people want to work for and with.
2. Digital futures - fostering strong, inclusive communities that are empowered to thrive in a digital world.
3. Environmental solutions - using technology to address environmental challenges and help suppliers, customers, and communities do the same[doc4].

The strategy is driven by the Sustainability, External Affairs and Legal (SEAL) team, which works across the business to manage sustainability-related risks and opportunities. Telstra also has a Climate Executives Group overseeing the climate change work program and an Audit and Risk Committee that reviews climate risk management and recommends targets to the Board[doc1][doc4].

In terms of environmental commitments, Telstra aims to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and has set ambitious goals including being carbon neutral in 2020, enabling renewable energy generation equivalent to 100% of their consumption by 2025, and reducing absolute emissions by at least 50% by 2030[doc1].","{""citations"": [{""content"": ""Our Sustainability, External Affairs and Legal (SEAL) team work\nacross the business to drive progress against the Strategy and manage\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities.

All this\ntranslates into plenty of action too. In December 2019, we announced our\ncommitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in line with\nthe Paris Agreement. We set further ambitious climate goals only a few months\nlater in March 2020: Be carbon neutral in 2020 Enable renewable energy\ngeneration equivalent to 100% of our consumption by 2025 Reduce our absolute\nemissions by at least 50% by 2030 This is important as, in an interconnected\nenergy grid, new renewable generation has the beneficial effect of\ndecarbonising the grid for everyone. Already, we are Australia’s largest\ncorporate purchaser of electricity from renewable projects connected to the\ngrid under project-specific agreements. While the output from these projects\ngoes into the total grid pool, rather than directly into our facilities, these\nagreements play a role in providing the investment certainty to enable these\nprojects to proceed. As the grid itself increases its proportion of renewable\nenergy due to agreements with us and others, the power that flows into our\nfacilities from the grid also becomes greener. The projects we have agreements\nwith, including such landmark sites as the Murra Warra Wind Farm and the\nEmerald Solar Park, generate renewable energy equivalent to the energy\nconsumption of 255,000 households. We will continue to build on this work and\ninvest in renewable energy generation. Effective waste management is an\nimportant component of the overall sustainability strategy too.

semantic,How does Telstra work on Digital Literacy?,"Telstra supports digital literacy through various programs and partnerships aimed at building digital skills in young people and enhancing the non-profit sector's digital capacity. Specifically, Telstra invests in coding, digital making, and digital literacy programs to help young people and their teachers use and understand technology. Additionally, they run Code Club Australia to provide free volunteer-led code clubs in schools and libraries, offering access to learning resources for teaching coding basics and skill-building. They also host the global Moonhack campaign to encourage more kids to code. Furthermore, Telstra's philanthropic strategy includes supporting initiatives like Playing it Safe & Media Literacy Lab by the Alannah & Madeline Foundation, which trains educators to teach digital literacy skills to children and teenagers, and the Indigital Schools program, which is a First Nations-led STEAM education initiative that incorporates First Nations' knowledge into digital skills teaching[doc1][doc2][doc3].

Telstra Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Telstra, is responsible for this philanthropic strategy in Australia, which is focused on enabling social change through technology.

Digital literacy Some employees may be less\nfamiliar or comfortable with the technologies, apps and concepts involved in\nremote working.

Workflow adherence When people are\nuncomfortable or unsure about a process, or find it burdensome and\nunnecessary, they might begin to skip steps, stick with familiar redundant\npractices, or develop unauthorised shortcuts. Ensure your workflows and\nprocesses perform seamlessly, irrespective of where your team members are\nlocated. Identify and address any potential points of friction.

As part of our normal procedures, we\nidentify and test the internal controls that are relevant to the external\naudit of the financial report. In our view, the internal controls that we\nidentified and tested were at the level we would expect for a top 10\nAustralian listed corporate. Thank you, Chairman JOHN MULLEN: Thank you, Mr\nFerguson. I would also add that from Telstra perspective, a comment on the\nreassurance that the board seeks on the system of internal control as part of\nhis process to approve the company's financial statements each half year. To\nthe end, the CEO and the CFO, provide a declaration required by the\nCorporations Act and the ASX Corporate Governance Principles and\nrecommendation. That declaration gives a confirmation relating to the proper\nmaintenance of the company's financial records and compliance with the\naccounting standards in the preparation of these financial statements. This\nincludes a personal declaration from the CEO and the CFO that their opinion\nhas been formed on the basis of a sound system of risk management and internal\ncontrol, which is operating effectively.

Telstra’s operating expenses increased by 4.1% during the\nyear. This would be due to the effects of inflation on Telstra’s business.\nTelstra increased prices to its customers by 7.1% during the year. Do you\nconsider increasing prices to your customers by 70% above Telstra’s inflation\nrate to be fair and reasonable? John Mullen: Thank you for the question. The\n4.1% figure is of course an aggregate of a huge amount of different inputs and\ncosts, it’s not just one single cost.

For buying shares, if you do not have a broker, you can refer to the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) website for information on how to find a broker. If you wish to sell your shares and you are an issuer-sponsored shareholder (denoted by a Security Reference Number or SRN), you can use the share sale facility provided by Link Market Services, Telstra's share registry. If your shares are sponsored by a participant (denoted by a Holder Identification Number or HIN), you will need to contact your sponsoring participant or broker. It is recommended to seek professional advice before deciding to buy or sell shares[doc4].

For U.S. investors, there are options such as contacting a local stockbroker or an Australian stockbroker to buy international shares, including Telstra's[doc4].

vectorSimpleHybrid,What is Telstra's sustainability strategy?,"Telstra’s sustainability strategy, referred to as ""the Strategy,"" encompasses several targets across three key pillars:

1. **Responsible business**: Telstra aims to be a globally trusted and sustainable company that is an attractive place to work and collaborate with. This involves driving progress against the Strategy and managing sustainability-related risks and opportunities [doc1][doc4].

2. **Digital futures**: The company seeks to foster strong, inclusive communities that can thrive in a digital world, empowering them through technology [doc4].

3. **Environmental solutions**: Telstra intends to use technology to address environmental challenges and assist its suppliers, customers, and communities in doing the same. This includes their commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, be carbon neutral in 2020, enable renewable energy generation equivalent to 100% of their consumption by 2025, and reduce absolute emissions by at least 50% by 2030 [doc1][doc4].

The sustainability strategy is supported by various groups within the company, including the Telstra Climate Executives Group that oversees the climate change work program, and the Telstra Audit and Risk Committee that oversees climate risk management and makes recommendations to the Board on targets [doc1][doc4]. Additionally, Telstra has been recognized by the Digital Production Partnership (DPP) Committed to Sustainability Programme, reflecting its commitment to environmental sustainability in the media industry [doc4].","{""citations"": [{""content"": ""Our Sustainability, External Affairs and Legal (SEAL) team work\nacross the business to drive progress against the Strategy and manage\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities.

We set further ambitious climate goals only a few months\nlater in March 2020: Be carbon neutral in 2020 Enable renewable energy\ngeneration equivalent to 100% of our consumption by 2025 Reduce our absolute\nemissions by at least 50% by 2030 This is important as, in an interconnected\nenergy grid, new renewable generation has the beneficial effect of\ndecarbonising the grid for everyone. Already, we are Australia’s largest\ncorporate purchaser of electricity from renewable projects connected to the\ngrid under project-specific agreements. While the output from these projects\ngoes into the total grid pool, rather than directly into our facilities, these\nagreements play a role in providing the investment certainty to enable these\nprojects to proceed. As the grid itself increases its proportion of renewable\nenergy due to agreements with us and others, the power that flows into our\nfacilities from the grid also becomes greener. The projects we have agreements\nwith, including such landmark sites as the Murra Warra Wind Farm and the\nEmerald Solar Park, generate renewable energy equivalent to the energy\nconsumption of 255,000 households. We will continue to build on this work and\ninvest in renewable energy generation. Effective waste management is an\nimportant component of the overall sustainability strategy too.

vectorSimpleHybrid,How does Telstra work on Digital Literacy?,"Telstra supports digital literacy through various programs aimed at enabling young people and their educators to use and understand technology. This includes coding, digital making, and digital literacy programs. For example, Telstra runs Code Club Australia, which supports free volunteer-led code clubs in schools and libraries, providing teachers with resources to teach coding basics and build skills[doc4]. Moreover, Telstra aims to upskill 500,000 Australians with digital skills by 2025, as part of their goal for digital inclusion[doc4][doc5].

Additionally, the Alannah & Madeline Foundation's Playing it Safe & Media Literacy Lab, supported by Telstra, trains educators to teach digital literacy skills to children ranging from toddlers to teens[doc1]. Telstra's digital literacy efforts also extend to vulnerable customers and communities, with over 59,000 people reached through their digital literacy programs, which include tech-savvy seniors, Telstra Digital ambassadors, and cyber safety awareness programs[doc2].

In summary, Telstra's approach to digital literacy is multifaceted, encompassing educational programs for young people, training for educators, community outreach, and the goal to significantly increase the digital skills of the Australian population[doc1][doc2][doc4][doc5].","{""citations"": [{""content"": ""run the annual, global Moonhack campaign to get more\nkids coding.

We are continually seeking to\nidentify ways that can use our technology, skills and scale to operate more\nresponsibly, better serve vulnerable customers and help safeguard the\nenvironment to create long term value for our company and the communities in\nwhich we operate. For example, this year, we helped more than 1 million\nvulnerable customers stay connected. We reached more than 59,000 people\nthrough our digital literacy programs, which includes tech savvy seniors,\nTelstra Digital ambassadors, and our cyber safety awareness programs. And we\nalso provided $175 million of value through our social and community\ninvestment programs, which includes sponsorship and disaster relief, employee\nvolunteering and giving, and our customer and community digital inclusion\nprograms. Under the federal government mobile blackspots program, we are\ndeploying 429 new 3G, 4G base stations over three years to improve mobile\ncoverage for over 400 communities across Australia. Last month, we activated\nthe 60th mobile base station under this program.

In the important area of reconciliation, Telstra\nthis year also launched a Reconciliation Action Plan, which aims to double the\nnumber of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees at Telstra over the\nnext three years, significantly expand telehealth network in remote areas and\nintroduce new programs in cyber security and digital literacy. We've also made\na significant commitment to infrastructure with a co-investment with the\nNorthern Territory government of $30 million over three years to fund new\nmobile services and broadband in remote communities. And finally, our ongoing\nfocus on the environment also saw our total carbon emissions decreased by 1.3%\nthis year. That's decrease in total carbon emissions, despite data loads on\nour network increasing by 36%. So in closing, I'd like to take this\nopportunity to thank Mr Penn and his senior executives and the entire Telstra\nteam for their efforts in delivering the many achievements I've described to\nyou this morning. Looking forward, there is no doubt the disruptive digital\ntechnologies will continue to drive a global wave of change that will\nincreasingly see everyone connected to everything through smart technologies,\nsmart devices and smart networks. The challenge for Telstra and indeed the\nchallenge for Australia as a nation, is to harness these many opportunities by\nfocusing on innovation. Telstra is innovating in the way we add value to our\nproducts and services, and in the way we foster new skills and mindsets\ncritical to success in a connected digital future.

Telstra’s operating expenses increased by 4.1% during the\nyear. This would be due to the effects of inflation on Telstra’s business.\nTelstra increased prices to its customers by 7.1% during the year. Do you\nconsider increasing prices to your customers by 70% above Telstra’s inflation\nrate to be fair and reasonable? John Mullen: Thank you for the question. The\n4.1% figure is of course an aggregate of a huge amount of different inputs and\ncosts, it’s not just one single cost.

If you wish to engage a broker, the ASX provides information on how to find one. You can refer to their website to find a broker or adviser. If you wish to sell your shares and you do not have a broker, you can go through Telstra's share registry, Link Market Services. Link offers a share sale facility to issuer-sponsored shareholders, who want to sell their entire shareholding, and can be contacted on 1300 886 677 or via email at telstra@linkmarketservices.com.au for share sale forms. If your shares are sponsored by a participant, denoted by a Holder Identification Number (HIN), you will need to contact your sponsoring participant or broker. It is advised to seek professional advice before deciding to buy or sell shares[doc4].

If you are in the US, you have a couple of options. You can contact a local stockbroker, as US brokers should be able to assist you in buying international shares, or you can contact an Australian stockbroker[doc4].

In terms of the benefit to shareholders, the\nparticipation in the buyback was an individual decision for shareholders,\ndepending on their circumstances, and as you point out, there are different\ncircumstances for different shareholders. But we believe that the buyback was\nin the best interests of all shareholders, and buybacks actually benefit\ncontinuing shareholders in the sense that there are fewer shares on issue and\ntherefore the earnings per share does go up and over the long term that\nunderpins the share price. So, a buyback has important benefits for continuing\nshareholders, just as it might provide benefits for those shareholders whose\ncircumstances lead them to participate in the buyback. But we did, as a board,\nwe deliberated and took into account the interests of all shareholders in\nmaking that decision as part of our portfolio of capital management, which did\ninclude, as you know, increasing our ordinary dividend both at the interim and\nthe final dividend this year.

And to do so at 14% reduction to the weekly average\ntrade is a bit like this scam bloke who sends us off letters to say I'll buy\nyou shares for nothing.

vectorSemanticHybrid,What is Telstra's sustainability strategy?,"Telstra's sustainability strategy encompasses several targets across three key pillars: 

1. Responsible business - Telstra aims to operate as a sustainable, globally trusted company that people want to work for and with.
2. Digital futures - The company seeks to foster strong, inclusive communities that are empowered to thrive in a digital world.
3. Environmental solutions - Telstra is committed to using technology to address environmental challenges and assist suppliers, customers, and communities in doing the same[doc4].

The sustainability strategy is driven by Telstra's Sustainability, External Affairs, and Legal (SEAL) team, which works across the business to manage sustainability-related risks and opportunities. Additionally, there is a Telstra Climate Executives Group that oversees the climate change work program and a Telstra Audit and Risk Committee that oversees climate risk management and makes recommendations to the Board on targets[doc1][doc4].

Telstra has also made specific commitments to environmental sustainability, such as achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, becoming carbon neutral in 2020, enabling renewable energy generation equivalent to 100% of their consumption by 2025, and reducing absolute emissions by at least 50% by 2030[doc1].","{""citations"": [{""content"": ""Our Sustainability, External Affairs and Legal (SEAL) team work\nacross the business to drive progress against the Strategy and manage\nsustainability-related risks and opportunities. As well as that, we have a\nTelstra Climate Executives Group that oversees the climate change work\nprogram, and a Telstra Audit and Risk Committee that oversees climate risk\nmanagement and makes recommendations to the Board on targets. All this\ntranslates into plenty of action too. In December 2019, we announced our\ncommitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in line with\nthe Paris Agreement. We set further ambitious climate goals only a few months\nlater in March 2020: Be carbon neutral in 2020 Enable renewable energy\ngeneration equivalent to 100% of our consumption by 2025 Reduce our absolute\nemissions by at least 50% by 2030 This is important as, in an interconnected\nenergy grid, new renewable generation has the beneficial effect of\ndecarbonising the grid for everyone. Already, we are Australia’s largest\ncorporate purchaser of electricity from renewable projects connected to the\ngrid under project-specific agreements. While the output from these projects\ngoes into the total grid pool, rather than directly into our facilities, these\nagreements play a role in providing the investment certainty to enable these\nprojects to proceed. As the grid itself increases its proportion of renewable\nenergy due to agreements with us and others, the power that flows into our\nfacilities from the grid also becomes greener. The projects we have agreements\nwith, including such landmark sites as the Murra Warra Wind Farm and the\nEmerald Solar Park, generate renewable energy equivalent to the energy\nconsumption of 255,000 households. We will continue to build on this work and\ninvest in renewable energy generation. Effective waste management is an\nimportant component of the overall sustainability strategy too.

vectorSemanticHybrid,How does Telstra work on Digital Literacy?,"Telstra is actively involved in digital literacy through several initiatives and partnerships aimed at building digital skills for young people and providing support to educators. They run programs like Code Club Australia, which supports free volunteer-led code clubs in schools and libraries, and provides teachers with learning resources to teach coding basics[doc3]. Additionally, they conduct the global Moonhack campaign to get more kids coding[doc3].

The Telstra Foundation, which is Telstra’s philanthropic arm, also focuses on digital literacy by funding programs that aim to train educators to teach important digital literacy skills to children and teenagers, as part of initiatives like the Playing it Safe & Media Literacy Lab in partnership with the Alannah & Madeline Foundation[doc1]. They support projects that build digital skills and literacy through initiatives like the Tech4Good Challenge and partnerships with organizations such as the Indigital Schools and Young Change Agents, which work on STEAM education and entrepreneurship programs respectively[doc1].

Moreover, Telstra has set a goal to upskill 500,000 Australians with digital skills by 2025, and their philanthropic strategy includes supporting coding, digital making, and digital literacy programs to help young people and their teachers use and understand technology[doc3]. They also assist the non-profit sector in building digital capacity to further digital inclusion[doc3].

Those costs, excluding stamp duty, are not\nconsidered to be material to the Telstra Group. The overall one-off costs\nassociated with the scheme, most of which have already been incurred or will\nbe incurred regardless of whether the scheme is implemented, are expected to\nbe $126 million excluding stamp dutyand comprise incremental IT systems and\nprocess costs, advisor fees, the cost of the independent expert, and costs\nassociated with the scheme meeting and ongoing additional costs for the\nTelstra Group that might not otherwise arise.
